After having installed SVG Badges it will be usable with no additional configuration. Indeed, by default, the plugin is configured as follows: 

* quality gate badges webservice is activated 
* measures badges webservice is activated 
* compute engine activity badges webservice is activated 

If you want to disable a specific badge type, you have to toggle the corresponding flag to `false` on SonarQube's administration page ("SVG Badges" section) as depicted on the following image.
