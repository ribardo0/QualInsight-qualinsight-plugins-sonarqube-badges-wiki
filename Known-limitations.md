Due to [SONAR-7628](https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONAR-7628), the SVG Badges plugin is currently not able to display quality gate badges if your SonarQube server is configured to restrict analysis execution rights [#42](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/issues/42). Note that, if "anybody" can execute an analysis, then quality gate badges are displayed correctly.  

If the security option "force user authentication" is set on your SonarQube instance, then all webservices become unreachable unless the user is authenticated. As a result, badges cannot be retrieved if this option is set. If you want more information about this limitation, have a look at issue [#15](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/issues/15) and [SONAR-6948](https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONAR-6948).)

Some metrics that return an array of data or data representing times or ratings cannot be correctly displayed as a measure badge for now. Maybe a future version of the plugin will handle such cases. Meantime, please stick to the list of supported metrics that is provided on this page.
