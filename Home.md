Welcome to the [SVG Badges plugin](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges) wiki!

You'll find here how to [install](Installation) and [configure](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/wiki/Configuration) the plugin, as well as information about 
[supported SonarQube versions](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/wiki/Requirements-and-Compatibility-Matrix).

The way to generate [Quality Gate badges](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/wiki/Quality-Gate-status-badges), [Measures badges](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/wiki/Measure-badges) and [CE Activity badges](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/wiki/Compute-Engine-Activity-badges) is explained on separate pages. There is also a pointer to a technical [webservices documentation](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/wiki/Webservices-documentation) .

There are unfortunately some [known limitations](https://github.com/QualInsight/qualinsight-plugins-sonarqube-badges/wiki/Known-limitations). Make sure to read them before using the plugin. This may help you not waste your time.
